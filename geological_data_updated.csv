"Peat (organic-rich)",Sediments,Lithology,"Superficial deposits. Type of soil formed by the partial decomposition of vegetation matter (Cook et al., 2022). Includes submerged forests.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Organic soils,"Organic soils can also be associated with biogenic gas due to the breakdown of organic matter. Fibrous peats have the ability to reinforce soils, causing issues for cable trenching works, and can also provide fluid migration pathways."
Glauconite,Sediments,Lithology,"Superficial deposits. Glauconite is an iron potassium mica with a characteristically green colour and low strength, often found in peloidal form. Glauconite generally forms under reducing conditions within a shallow marine depositional environment. Glauconite can be characterised as sand-sized grains but transforms into fine-grained soil upon shearing due to particle crushing.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Moderate constraint,Crushable soil,"Crushing of glauconite results in high pile friction and transition from sand to clay-like behaviour. May result in pile fatigue or refusal. Difference in properties between allogenic (reworked) vs. authogenic (insitu). Reworked glauconite can wash away weaker minerals."

May include marine mud basins including soft glaciolacustrine/glaciomarine (not overconsolidated) mud deposition or other soft muddy shelfful deposits.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Soft sediments,"A hard stratum overlying a weaker one presents a danger that may cause a foundation to punch through the softer sediments. Low strength means soft muds will not bear large loads. Acid sulphate soils (ASS) may contain harmful substances affecting cables, when exposed and/or dredged in coastal areas (Finland)."

"Carbonate sands",Sediments,Lithology,"Calcareous and carbonate soils can be identified by their reaction with dilute hydrochloric acid, producing carbon dioxide that bubbles off. The grains consists partially or completely of calcium carbonate and may be formed of the skeletal remains of microscopic marine plant and animal remains. Calcium carbonate is a relatively soft mineral compared with silica-based soils (Mitchell and Soga, 2005).",Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Crushable soil,"The crushability of carbonate grains make carbonate sands unreliable foundation materials (Murff, 1987; Jewell and Khorshid 2000; Kolk, 2000). Calcareous sands are difficult to classify and can be highly contractive."

"Glacifluvial delta (aka. glacier-fed delta)",Glacial,"Lithology, relief","There are many different kinds of deltas; all have relatively flat delta plains, frequently triangular (fan) shaped in plan view, and steeper delta front slopes. In cross-section, the archetypal delta consists of flat-lying topset beds over steeper foreset beds, which rest on bottomset beds that are usually thin and fine-grained. The typical GLACIFLUVIAL DELTA usually consists of coarser-grained sediments, and their front slopes are steep with foreset beds generally dipping 10-30° Bell et al. 1997. In: Dowdeswell et al., 2016). GLACIFLUVIAL DELTAS are also referred to as glacier-fed deltas as terrestrial proglacial meltwater streams/rivers carry sediments from a glacier to the marine/lacustrine environment (Benn and Evans, 2010).",Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Higher Constraint,Moderate constraint,"Uneven ground / coarse soil units / homogeneous soils","May require seabed preparation before installation of foundations. Variable soil units provide a challenge for suction caisson, particularly where potential thick gravel beds are interbedded with finer-grained soil units. Thick gravel beds can reduce friction along the outer surface. Potential for coarse gravel beds, and variability in soil profiles over the delta. This makes selecting a cable trenching tool more challenging as some tools can handle dense, coarse soil units whereas some cannot."
"Erratic or glaciotectonic raft",Glacial,"Lithology, relief","Large rock or boulder carried by a glacier or by floating ice and deposited when the ice melted, well away from its place of origin and therefore contrasting with the country rock (Bell et al. 1997. In: Dowdeswell et al., 2016)",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Rafts or boulders,"If unaccounted for, can provide significant challenge/constraint to most/all subsurface foundations (e.g., pile refusal / tip damage, damage / refusal or uneven emplacement of suction caisson and skirts for gravity base structures, cable/pipeline plough pop-up or deviation, poor penetration for drag embedment anchors). Significant and unexpected vertical and lateral variability in ground conditions incl. geotechnical parameters."

"Marine bar form (Contourite drift/ sediment apron/ sediment drift/ sediment lobe/energetic wave or current regime)",Marine,"Lithology, relief","Tend to be larger than CURRENT-INDUCED BEDFORMS (e.g. Venditti, 2013), are often forced by macro-scale topography (e.g. channels – point bar; headlands - banner), and develop over longer periods of time (e.g. Dury, 1970).",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Active sedimentary system,"Indicative of mobile sediments. Mobility may remove sediment from around the foundation and buried skirt, anchor, or conversely may increase lateral loading on side of foundation. Mobility may remove sediment overlying the buried cable which will leave it at risk from anchor interactions, and conversely may increase the sediment volume overlying the buried cable which can result in the cable exceeding the thermal threshold and hotspots developing."
"Submarine canyon (canyon/ canyon head / canyon mouth / tributary canyon)",Marine,"Lithology, relief","Steep-sided, GENERALLY V-shaped valleys with heads at or near the CONTINENTAL SHELF edge. They extend across the CONTINENTALSLOPE and are commonly linked to numerous tributaries, similar to unglaciated river-cut canyons on land (Amblas et al., 2018; Covault,2011; Harris and Baker, 2011; Huang et al., 2014; Pratson et al., 2007; Puig et al., 2014).",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Active sedimentary system,"Typically extremely dynamic environments incl. sediment gravity flows / landslides, internal tides with high current velocities, mobile bedforms. Bedrock is often exposed along steep canyon flanks and terraces, also leading to very variable ground conditions. High water depths make submarine canyons unsuitable for all fixed foundations, and very unfavourable for anchoring systems. May be used for cables and pipelines but comprehensive due diligence / hazard assessments must be undertaken."
"Open river valley / channel",Fluvial,"Lithology, relief","Form via combinations of fluvial and coastal processes (see Additional Attributes: Marginal marine process classification); they widen by lateral SUBAERIAL CHANNEL erosion and weathering, and lengthen by both headward erosion and progradation in their lower reaches.

"Bedrock outcrop/subcrop (undifferentiated)",Solid Earth,Lithology,"A relief formed by bedrock of unspecified lithology and genesis cropping out of the surrounding seabed. Subcropping of bedrock can be common and covered by thin sediment covers in sediment starved shelves.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Lower Constraint,Higher Constraint,Strong bedrock - undifferentiated,"Depending on the lithology and strength of the bedrock, pile driving may be successful however that would require significant weathering of rockhead to reduce the bedrock to strengths comparable with unlithified deposits (e.g., stiff clay characteristics). Cables must be surface-laid, increasing exposure to environmental and anthropogenic hazards. Sensitive benthic communities must be protected."
"Fractured bed rock",Solid Earth,Structure,"Bedrock of unspecified lithology and genesis that has multiple fractures or fracture networks causing discontinuities in the host rock that can be exploited by erosion.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Uneven ground,"Depending on the original porosity of the host bedrock, the secondary porosity is controlled by the density of the fracture or discontinuity network. Fractures and joints may act as conduits for surface and ground water increasing likelihood of weathering resulting in variable ground conditions. Cables must be surface-laid, increasing exposure to environmental and anthropogenic hazards."
