# Data Alignment Summary

## Overview
- **CSV**: 86 geological features, 11 columns
- **Excel**: 86 geological features, 56 columns (extensive metadata)
- **Match Rate**: 60.5% (52/86 features match exactly)

## Key Findings

### 1. Structure Alignment
✓ Both datasets have the same number of geological features (86)
✓ Core data structure is similar
✓ Assessment values appear to match where features align

### 2. Feature Name Differences
The main issue is that feature names have slight differences in formatting:

**CSV Format vs Excel Format:**
- "back barrier" vs "back barrier (flats and lagoons)"
- "basin / basin plain" vs "basin / basin plain / intraslope basin"
- "bedrock outcrop (carbonate)" vs "bedrock outcrop/subcrop; carbonate"
- "buried eustatic escarpment" vs "buried or exposed eustatic escarpment (excessive seabed gradient)"

### 3. Assessment Data Alignment
Sample comparisons show that constraint assessments match correctly:
- Soft mud: Both show "Higher Constraint" for piles
- Erratic/glaciotectonic raft: Both show "Higher Constraint" for piles  
- Esker: Both show "Moderate constraint" for piles

## Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY: Update CSV feature names
The CSV should be updated to match the Excel naming conventions for:

1. **Detailed descriptions**: Excel has more comprehensive feature names
2. **Consistency**: Some features use "/" vs "(" formatting inconsistently
3. **Completeness**: Excel names often include important clarifications

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Verify all assessment data
- Spot check showed good alignment for constraint assessments
- Should verify all foundation types (Piles, Suction Caisson, GBS, Cables)
- Check that all 52 matching features have identical assessment values

### LOW PRIORITY: Column structure
- Current CSV has the essential columns needed for the app
- Excel has extensive additional metadata that could be valuable for future features

## Scientific Accuracy Status
✓ **Core data appears scientifically accurate** - assessments match between sources
⚠ **Feature naming needs standardization** - 39% of features have naming mismatches
✓ **Data completeness is good** - all essential assessment columns present

## Action Items
1. Update CSV geological feature names to match Excel exactly
2. Verify assessment values for all foundation types
3. Consider adding additional metadata columns from Excel if needed for future features
