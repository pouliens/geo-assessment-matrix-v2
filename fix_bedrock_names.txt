BEDROCK NAME FIXES NEEDED:

In both reference-geological-constraints.csv and reference-engineering-constraints.csv:

CHANGE FROM → CHANGE TO:
Bedrock outcrop/subcrop (undifferentiated) → Bedrock outcrop (undifferentiated)
Bedrock outcrop/subcrop; carbonate → Bedrock outcrop (carbonate)
Bedrock outcrop/subcrop; sedimentary; clastic → Bedrock outcrop (sedimentary clastic)
Bedrock outcrop/subcrop; igneous → Bedrock outcrop (igneous)
Bedrock outcrop/subcrop; metamorphic → Bedrock outcrop (metamorphic)

The names in geological_data.csv are correct and should be the master reference.
