Tidal flat,Coastal,Lithology,Lithology,Low gradient intertidal to supratidal surfaces formed in fine-grained sediment.,Moderate constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Moderate constraint,Shallow water depth,"A hard stratum overlying a weaker one presents a danger that may cause a foundation to punch through the softer sediments. 

Exposure of near shore cables may result from coastal processes; increasing risk to cables from external threats. Cables can be protected via Horizontal drilling (HDD). "
Trough,Physiography,Relief,Relief,A long depression generally wide and flat-bottomed with symmetrical and parallel sides. Sides usually steeper than 5 degrees.,Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Moderate constraint,Uneven ground,"May require seabed preparation before installation of foundations. Sometimes, troughs can be dynamic environments and mobile sediments can be present."
U-shaped valley (Fjord),Glacial,Relief,Relief,A valley having pronounced parabolic cross-profile with steep parallel walls and broad nearly flat floor carved by glacial erosion.,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,>5 degree slope,"Can be prone to avalanches, ice, natural hazards and vulnerable to inclement weather that can take down transmission lines (Barajas, 2019)."
Volcano or volcanic feature,Solid Earth,Geohazard,Geohazard,Mountain or hill typically conical having crater or vent through which lava rock fragments hot vapour and gas are erupted.,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Volcano,"Unsuitable for all infrastructure types due to typically deep water settings, steep slopes, extremely strong lithologies, and associated hazards (e.g., seismic activity). Geohazard considered where dynamic geological event or process that is a risk to development. "
