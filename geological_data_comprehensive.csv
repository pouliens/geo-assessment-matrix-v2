Peat (organic-rich),Sediments,Lithology,"Superficial deposits. Type of soil formed by the partial decomposition of vegetation matter (Cook et al., 2022). Includes submerged forests.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Organic soils,"Organic soils can also be associated with biogenic gas due to the breakdown of organic matter. Fibrous peats have the ability to reinforce soils, causing issues for cable trenching works, and can also provide fluid migration pathways.",Spatial soil variability (lateral/vertical);Soft  soil units - low shear strength ;Organic soils/gassy sediments,"Low thermal conductivity/low water content, overheating;Compressible/ contractive soils;Trenching technique selection;Reduced shaft friction - soft sediments;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"
Glauconite,Sediments,Lithology,"Superficial deposits. Glauconite is an iron potassium mica with a characteristically green colour and low strength, often found in peloidal form. Glauconite generally forms under reducing conditions within a shallow marine depositional environment. Glauconite can be characterised as sand-sized grains but transforms into fine-grained soil upon shearing due to particle crushing.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Moderate constraint,Crushable soil,"Crushing of glauconite results in high pile friction and transition from sand to clay-like behaviour. May result in pile fatigue or refusal. Difference in properties between allogenic (reworked) vs. authogenic (insitu). Reworked glauconite can wash away weaker minerals.",Soft  soil units - low shear strength ,"Compressible/ contractive soils;Soil changes character upon crushing;Poor drivability/refusal;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"
Soft mud,Sediments,Lithology,"Superficial deposits. May include marine mud basins including soft glaciolacustrine/glaciomarine (not overconsolidated) mud deposition or other soft muddy shelfful deposits.",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Soft sediments,"A hard stratum overlying a weaker one presents a danger that may cause a foundation to punch through the softer sediments. Low strength means soft muds will not bear large loads. Acid sulphate soils (ASS) may contain harmful substances affecting cables, when exposed and/or dredged in coastal areas (Finland).",Soft  soil units - low shear strength ,"Reduced shaft friction - soft sediments;Voids/ punch through/ pile run;Poor drivability/refusal;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"
Sand,Sediments,Lithology,Superficial deposits,Lower Constraint,Moderate constraint,Higher Constraint,Lower Constraint,Homogenous sediments,"Present-day sands may be related to mobile sediments. Dense sands could be problematic for suction buckets. Loose sands would be problematic for GBS.",Coarse soil units (including gravel),"Collapsable soils;Potential important resource;Poor drivability/refusal;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"

Submarine canyon (canyon/ canyon head / canyon mouth / tributary canyon),Marine,"Lithology, relief","Steep-sided, GENERALLY V-shaped valleys with heads at or near the CONTINENTAL SHELF edge. They extend across the CONTINENTALSLOPE and are commonly linked to numerous tributaries, similar to unglaciated river-cut canyons on land (Amblas et al., 2018; Covault,2011; Harris and Baker, 2011; Huang et al., 2014; Pratson et al., 2007; Puig et al., 2014).",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Active sedimentary system,"Typically extremely dynamic environments incl. sediment gravity flows / landslides, internal tides with high current velocities, mobile bedforms. Bedrock is often exposed along steep canyon flanks and terraces, also leading to very variable ground conditions. High water depths make submarine canyons unsuitable for all fixed foundations, and very unfavourable for anchoring systems. May be used for cables and pipelines but comprehensive due diligence / hazard assessments must be undertaken.",Spatial soil variability (lateral/vertical);Strong bedrock at/near seabed;Uneven ground (relief);Steep slopes/margins (>5 degree angle);Active sedimentary system (inc. mobile sediments);Deep water (<200 m);Potential  slope failure,"Potential important resource;Cable/pipeline abrasion or bending;Freespan development;Cable plough deviation;Scour - removal of lateral support;Uneven load distribution/differential settlement;Potentially unsuitable;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"
Rocky coast,Coastal,Lithology,Any length of coast that is predominantly characterised by rock (rather than sediment or vegetation),Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Moderate constraint,Shallow water depth (<15-20 m),"Boulders can occur occasionally, especially in the areas of Rapakivi granite bedrock, and De Geer moraine fields (e.g., Finland). Exposure of near shore cables may result from coastal processes; increasing risk to cables from external threats. Cables can be protected via Horizontal drilling (HDD).",Rafts or boulders;Strong bedrock at/near seabed;Uneven ground (relief);Shallow water (<15-20 m),"Potential important resource;Poor drivability/refusal;Damage to tool/foundation during installation;Requires individual WTG siting investigation"
Erratic or glaciotectonic raft,Glacial,"Lithology, relief","Large rock or boulder carried by a glacier or by floating ice and deposited when the ice melted, well away from its place of origin and therefore contrasting with the country rock (Bell et al. 1997. In: Dowdeswell et al., 2016)",Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Higher Constraint,Rafts or boulders,"If unaccounted for, can provide significant challenge/constraint to most/all subsurface foundations (e.g., pile refusal / tip damage, damage / refusal or uneven emplacement of suction caisson and skirts for gravity base structures, cable/pipeline plough pop-up or deviation, poor penetration for drag embedment anchors).
